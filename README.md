# DFIR TEMPLATES

Hi All,

Since there is so many amazing people creating incredible DFIR tools, I thought I'd focus on the thing everyone hates DOCUMENTATION. Will be updating Incident Response documents
and procedures to help you get those pesky reports done and take notes quickly and efficiently. Always appreciate any feedback


Current Documents:

* **Incident_Evidence_Timeline.xlsx** == Template for creating your own timeline along with tracking IOCs

* **TEMPLATE_Final Report** == Don't know where to start with your report, well use this template to have some solid headers and ideas

* **TEMPLATE_InvestigationNotes** == This is where you list out your notes while investigating, if you fill this out you wil have 90% of your report written

* **TEMPLATE_Scoping** == Pregenerated questions to ask while trying to figure out what this incident is about. TIP: Have one person ask and another write the answers
